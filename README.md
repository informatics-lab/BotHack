- @FortunatelyUnfortunatelyBot
- @StrangeWeatherBot
- @SongLyricBot
- @StudentFoodBot
- @CreativeBaristaBot
- @RejectedPatentBot
- @BadDirectionsBot
- @MarsRoverBot
- @RomComBot
- @BadCodeBot

- @PacManBot

# Create a Twitter account
Sign out of Twitter and create a new account for your bot with its name and handle. 

You'll need to provide an email address, which might be tricky if you already have a Twitter account. You can either use a different address, or use one of the workarounds listed [here](http://thesocialmediaguide.com.au/how-to-setup-multiple-twitter-accounts-with-one-email-address/).

# Set up your bot
For this tutorial, we'll be using a site called [Cheap Bots Done Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/). Go to their homepage and sign in with the Twitter account you just made.
